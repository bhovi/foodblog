        <h1>BBQ Jackfruit Sandwiches</h1>
        <img src="BBQ-Jackfruit-Sandwiches-3.jpg" alt="min" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Shred the Jackfruit: Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium high heat.
            Add the jackfruit and break it apart into “shreds” with the back of a spoon.
            Make the Filling: In a small chopper or food processor, pulse your chickpeas and garlic until they have a
            finely chopped texture. Add the mixture to the pan, along with the brown sugar and spices. Stir it all up to
            get it seasoned and happy.
            Add barbecue sauce and let it get a little roasty.
            Assemble Sandwiches: Serve your jackfruit BBQ on a bun topped with slaw and anything else you like!
            Add a pile of salt & pepper chips to your plate
        </p>
        <h1>Loaded Caprese Grilled Cheese</h1>
        <img src="Caprese-Grilled-Cheese-5-400x400.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>
            Make the Garlic Butter Tomato Sauce. Pour the tomatoes into a dry nonstick skillet.
            Heat until they start to get just slightly charred on the outside.
            Reduce heat and add one tablespoons of butter and give it a stir (it will probably splatter).
            Press the tomatoes gently with the back of a wooden spoon to release their juices.
            Add balsamic, garlic, and one more tablespoon butter.
            Simmer all together until thick and yummy. Season with salt and pepper.
            Assemble. Layer the pesto, cheese, and tomato sauce onto a slice of bread.
            Top with a slice of bread, spread with butter on the outside of the bread. (Repeat for second sandwich.)
            Pan-fry. Transfer your sandwich to a skillet over medium high heat.
            Cook until the cheese is melted, flipping once or twice to get both sides browned.
        </p>
        <h1> Avocado Egg Salad</h1>
        <img src="Avocado-Egg-Salad-3-400x400.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>
            Hard boil the eggs. Cover the eggs with water in a saucepan.
            Bring to a boil, turn heat off, cover and rest (on hot burner) for 8-10 minutes.
            Run under cold water and break off the shells. Cut the eggs into small pieces.
            Mash the avocados. Mash the avocados in a bowl with the back of a large wooden spoon until mostly smooth.
            Mix and serve. Mix the eggs with the avocados, herbs, lemon juice, salt, and olive oil if you need it.
            Serve immediately at room temperature, or chill and serve cold.
        </p>
        <h1>vegan Crunchwrap</h1>
        <img src="Vegan-Crunchwraps-with-Cashew-Queso.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Sofritas Tofu: Heat oil over medium high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Add tofu and break apart into
            crumbles.
            Add taco seasoning, salt, chipotles, and salsa.
            Get it all going in the pan, nice and hot.
            Finish by letting everything sit without stirring for another 10+ minutes
            (adding oil to prevent sticking as needed) until you get some nice browned, almost-crunchy pieces. <br>
            Cashew Queso: Blend everything together aggressively until smooth! <br>
            Crunch Wrap Time: Lay a large tortilla on a flat surface. Layer: tofu, queso, crunchy stuff,
            and any other extras you want in there.
            Fold in the edges of the tortilla toward the center.
            Place in a hot oiled skillet, seam side down. Cook for a few minutes on each side until the exterior is
            firm,
            crunchy, and golden brown. Cut and serve!
        </p>
        <h1>Spicy Tofu Burgers</h1>
        <img src="Tofu-Burgers-1-2-400x400.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>
            Press the water out of your tofu using a tofu press or just laying a heavy pan on top of it for 20-30
            minutes.
            Mash the tofu using your hands or a spoon until it’s crumbly. Mix in the remaining burger ingredients.
            Form into 4 patties.
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
            Fry the burgers in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil first to get the outsides nice and browned.
            Then transfer to the oven and bake for 20-or-so minutes, until the burgers are firm to the touch on the
            outside.
            (You can throw some peppers or onions in the pan with the burgers if you want to cook them up at the same
            time)
            Serve on toasted buns with sriracha, mayo, and fresh veggies and herbs
