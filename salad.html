        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
            Arrange the sweet potatoes on a large sheet pan with the shallots and herbs. Toss with olive oil and salt.
            Roast for 20 minutes.
            Add chickpeas to the pan. Stir it all up. Roast for another 20 minutes.
            Toss walnuts with maple syrup and a little more salt. Add mapley walnuts to the pan.
            Stir it up. Roast for another 5 minutes.
            Remove the stems of the herbs. Serve roasted mixture with cooked quinoa, baby kale, and dressing of choice.
            Healthy and delicious!

        <h1>Cashew Crunch Salad</h1>
        <img src="Cashew-Crunch-Salad.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>
            1/2 head of green cabbage, finely shredded.
            1/2 head of purple cabbage, finely shredded.
            2 cups carrots, matchstick-cut or shredded.
            1 cup fresh cilantro, chopped.
            1/2 cup sliced green onion.
            2 cups cooked edamame.
            2 cup roasted cashews.
            2 cups crunchy chow mein noodles (optional).
            chicken, shrimp, or any other protein you like <br>
            Dressing: <br>
            1/4 cup olive oil (you can use any other oil as well).
            3 tablespoons white vinegar.
            2 tablespoons sesame oil -very important for flavor!
            2 tablespoons sugar.
            1 teaspoon salt.
            a few shakes of garlic powder.
            optional: 1/4 cup Greek yogurt or mayo
            (more or less to taste -this changes it from a vinaigrette to more of a creamy dressing).

        <h1>Simple Green Salad</h1>
        <img src="Simple-Green-Salad.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Dressing <br>
            1/4 cup maple syrup
            1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
            1/2 cup olive oil
            1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
            1 teaspoon salt
            black pepper to taste
            Salad
            4 cups spring greens
            seeds, nuts, or any other crunchies for topping if you want (not necessary though!) <br>
            INSTRUCTIONS <br>
            Shake dressing ingredients up in a jar. Taste and adjust to get it just right for how you like it.
            Toss a generous amount of spring greens with just a few light drizzles of dressing – you want to get the
            leaves entirely coated in dressing (but not so much that they get soggy). I often use my hands to gently
            toss it well without breaking all the greens. Serve immediately.

        <h1>Garlic Herb Chicken Salad</h1>
        <img src="Bruschetta-Chicken-Salad-1-3.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Salad Base: <br>
            2 cups cooked mixed brown rice and quinoa (I use the pre-cooked Seeds of Change mix)
            2 cups cooked chicken, chopped (store-bought rotisserie chicken works like a charm)
            2 cups tomatoes, chopped <br>
            Creamy Basil Dressing: <br>
            1/2 cup walnuts (can sub almonds)
            3/4 cup olive oil
            1/2 cup water
            1/2 cup basil
            1/2 cup parsley
            1 clove garlic
            juice of two lemons
            1 teaspoon salt <br>
            INSTRUCTIONS <br>
            Toss the brown rice / quinoa, chicken, and tomatoes together.
            For the dressing, whiz everything together in the food processor until
            mostly smooth and a little bit creamy. Taste and adjust as necessary.
            Pour the dressing over the salad ingredients then
            letting it all sit together for 30 minutes helps the flavors become x-tra delicious.

        <h1>The Oliver's Salad</h1>
        <img src="The-Olivers-Salad.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>
            1/2 cup mayo
            1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream
            1/2 cup milk or buttermilk
            1 teaspoon white vinegar or lemon juice (more to taste)
            2 teaspoons freeze-dried dill
            2 teaspoons freeze-dried chives
            1–2 teaspoons smoked paprika
            1/2 teaspoon onion powder
            1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
            1/2 teaspoon salt
            black pepper to taste
            The Pepper Confit

            3 tablespoons olive oil
            1 pound mini sweet peppers, sliced into rings
            3 cloves garlic, sliced into thin pieces
            1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
            salt to taste
            The You-Picks

            spinach or salad greens (about 2 cups per serving)
            salmon or chicken (about 3-4 ounces per serving)
            avocado (about half of one avocado per serving)
            bacon, cooked and crumbled
            fire-roasted corn
            sunflower seeds <br>
            INSTRUCTIONS <br>
            Smoked Ranch: Shake all ingredients in a jar until smooth. Taste and adjust. Make it yours!
            Pepper Confit: Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and sauté until brown and
            very soft, stirring only occasionally so you get some nice browning on them. I usually cook them for 20-30
            minutes. During the last 10-15 minutes, add in the garlic with the peppers to get it nice and golden and
            soft (just make sure you don’t burn it). During the last 5 minutes, add the vinegar to add some zip and pull
            up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
            Bacon: Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Drain and cool on a paper-towel lined plate. Crumble for the
            salad.
            Salmon: Pat dry and season with salt and pepper. Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes (depending on the size
            of your piece of salmon and desired doneness).
            Salad: Assemble everything over greens and drizzle with the smoked ranch. SO GOOD.</p>
