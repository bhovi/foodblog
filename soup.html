        <p>
            Sauté: Heat the oil in a deep soup pot. Add the onion, garlic, cauliflower, cashews, and turmeric.
            Sauté for 10 minutes or until very fragrant.
            Simmer: Add the water (I usually start with 4 cups) and salt. Simmer until softened.
            Blend: Transfer the soup to a blender and blend into a creamy consistency. It’s best to do this in batches.
            Finish: Return to the soup pot and add any additional water (remaining 2-3 cups) if you need to thin it out.
            Also a good time to season with more salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.
            Also a good time to top with spiced chickpeas and parsley and olive oil and more salt

        <p>Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and shallots. Sauté for 3-5
            minutes.
            Add the chicken thighs. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and turmeric. Cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes.
            (Add 1/4 cup water to the pan to create a little steam bath if it’s getting too browned on the bottom.)
            Flip and repeat until cooked through. Remove chicken and set aside.
            Add spinach and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the pan. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Remove spinach and set
            aside.
            Add rice to the pan. Sauté for 1-2 minutes so it picks up all the good pan flavors.
            Add 6 cups broth and bring to a simmer.
            While the rice is cooking, shred the chicken.
            When the rice is soft, add chicken and spinach back to the pan.
            Season with lime juice, soy sauce / fish sauce, and fresh herbs. Add extra broth as needed. YUM.
        </p>
        <h1>Creamy Mushroom Soup</h1>
        <img src="Mushroom-Soup.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>Heat the butter and oil in a soup pot over medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots;
            sauté for 10 minutes until soft, fragrant, and delicious. Add the garlic; sauté for 1-2 minutes.
            Add the flour; stir to coat everything. It will be very thick and dry (see notes).
            Add the wine slowly, letting the mixture loosen up. Add the broth slowly, stirring to form a smooth-ish
            soup.
            Add the cream and the salt, pepper, and herbs.
            Don’t boil it, but if you can give it a little bit of time to just hang out over very low heat,
            the flavors get better with just a little time to sit.
