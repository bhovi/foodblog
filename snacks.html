        <h1>Strawberry Oat Crumble Bars</h1>
        <img src="Jam-Bars-1-3.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p>1 1/4 cups strawberry jam
            1 cup hulled sunflower seeds
            3 cups gluten-free rolled oats
            1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
            1/2 cup virgin coconut oil
            1/4 cup pure maple syrup
            3 tablespoons brown rice syrup
            1 tablespoon sunflower seed butter
            INSTRUCTIONS
            If desired, roast the sunflower seeds: Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).
            Spread the seeds over a large rimmed baking sheet in an even layer.
            Roast for 9 to 12 minutes, until lightly golden in some spots. Remove from the oven and set aside.
            Increase the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C).
            Line a 9-inch (2.5 L) square pan (or an 8-inch/2 L pan for a slightly thicker bar) with parchment paper,
            leaving some overhang, which will make it easy to lift out the bars later.
            In a food processor, combine the sunflower seeds, oats, and salt and process until you have a coarse flour.
            In a small pot, melt the oil over low heat.
            Remove from the heat and whisk in the maple syrup, brown rice syrup, and sunflower seed butter until
            combined.
            Pour the wet mixture on top of the oat mixture in the food processor and process until the mixture comes
            together,
            10 to 15 seconds. The dough should feel quite heavy and oily, and there shouldn’t be any dry patches.
            If there are, process for 5 seconds more.
            If for some reason it’s still too dry, try adding water, a teaspoon (5 mL) at a time,
            and processing again until it comes together.
            Set aside 1¼ cups (300 mL) of the oat mixture for the topping.
            Crumble the remaining oat mixture over the base of the prepared pan in an even layer.
            Starting at the center, push down with your fingers (you can lightly wet them if they stick) to
            spread out and pack down the crust. Press the dough down tightly. Even out the edges with your fingertips.
            Prick the crust with the tines of a fork 9 times to allow steam to escape.
            Prebake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
            (If the crust puffed up while baking, gently press down on it to release the air.)
            Spread the jam in an even layer over the crust.
            Crumble the reserved 1¼ cups (300 mL) oat mixture evenly over the jam.
            Bake, uncovered, for 14 to 18 minutes more, until the topping is lightly firm to the touch.
            The topping will not turn golden in color; it will remain the same shade as it was before baking.
            Let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 45 to 60 minutes,
            then transfer the pan to the freezer for 30 minutes until completely cool.
            Lift out the slab and slice it into squares or bars.
            Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for several days,
            or wrapped up and stored in the freezer for 4 to 5 weeks.

        <h1>Triple Berry Cheesecake Muffins</h1>
        <img src="Berry-Cheesecake-Muffins-5.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p> Streusel: Soften or melt the butter, and use your hands to mix it with the brown sugar, flour, and salt.
            You should get the consistency that matches the pictures above – like small pebbles. <br>
            Cheesecake Layer: Beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add egg and sugar; beat again until smooth. <br>
            Muffins: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Beat the butter and sugars together until creamed.
            Add the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla; stir until combined.
            Add the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt;
            mix until just combined.
            The batter will be thick. Fold in the frozen berries just before assembling the muffins. <br>
            Layering: Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
            Press 1-2 tablespoons of batter into the bottom of each muffin tin.
            Flatten with the back of a wet spoon. Pour a spoonful of cheesecake mixture over the top.
            Cover with another 1-2 tablespoons of muffin batter.
            Sprinkle with streusel. <br>
            Bake: Bake for 5 minutes at 425 degrees, then turn the oven temperature down to 350 and bake for another
            15-18 minutes. <br>

        <h1>Coconut Oil Granola</h1>
        <img src="Coconut-Oil-Granola-2.jpg" alt="mmm" width="200px" height="200px">
        <p> 3 cups rolled oats
            1 heaping cup flaked unsweetened coconut
            1 heaping cup sliced almonds
            1 cup chopped pistachios
            1/4 cup flax seeds
            3/4 cup coconut oil, melted
            2 tablespoons honey
            2 tablespoons real maple syrup
            1 teaspoon cinnamon
            1 teaspoon salt
            1/2 cup golden raisins, or other dried fruit <br>
            INSTRUCTIONS <br>
            Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
            Mix everything (except the golden raisins) in a large bowl. Spread the mixture on a large baking sheet in a
            thin layer.
            Bake for 30 minutes. Stir in the golden raisins, and bake for another 15 minutes.
            Let the granola sit on the baking sheet for another 10-15 minutes so that clusters can form. YUMMM.
