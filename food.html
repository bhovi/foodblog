        <h1>SOUPS</h1>
        <p>Soup is the beeeeest! Honestly, it's one of our favorite food groups.
            There is nothing quite like curling up with a steaming cozy bowl of soup slurped by
            the spoonful or devoured with crusty bread dips.
        </p>
        <h1>SALADS</h1>
        <p>Traditional lettuce-chomping salads but also noodley salads, mayo-based salads, grain salads..
            .so many ways to salad! We promise these recipes will have you feeling full and happy.
        </p>
        <h1>SNACKS</h1>
        <p>
            To be clear, we can make almost anything a snack around here. Spare buffalo chicken taco?
            Couple forkfuls of cold noodle salad from the fridge? Who put this homemade oreo here?
            But ok, we also have a whole slew of more traditional type snackables for you to choose from.
        </p>
        <h1>SANDWICHES</h1>
        <p>
            we love a sandwich any time of day,
            so we have got ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just sandwich 0'clock here because
            you can never really go wrong with a bunch of delicious things between bread, brioche, bagels, tortill asâ€¦we
            got you.
